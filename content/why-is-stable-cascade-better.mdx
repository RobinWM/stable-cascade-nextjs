## Aesthetic quality

The model’s performance evaluation showed a significant increase in aesthetic quality compared to Stable Diffusion XL.

Stable Cascade performed 2.5x times better than SDXL and 5.5x times better than SDXL Turbo!

## Faster inference

Due to changes in architecture, Stable Cascade is more cost effective in terms of inference resource usage. Unlike Stable Diffusion, which operates with a compression factor of 8, Stable Cascade achieves an impressive factor of 42. This allows it to compress 1024×1024 images into 24×24 dimensions without sacrificing quality and vastly improving inference speed.

## Better prompt understanding

Human evaluation tests show improved prompt alignment compared to Stable Diffusion models. It means that the model understands your prompts better, both short and detailed.
